            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>Adhora,</p>

                <p>Five years ago, I met a friend. Somewhere along the way, without either of us trying or planning, that friend became my best friend. It happened so naturally that I couldn't tell you the exact moment it shifted; it just felt right, like breathing. And then, one day, I realized my heart had made another decision without asking my permission first. The butterflies arrived. The daydreams of tomorrow multiplied. I didn't just want you in my present. I wanted you in every future I could imagine.</p>

                <p>Pablo Neruda once wrote, "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride." I think we were always heading here, Adhora. Every laugh, every late-night conversation, every moment of comfortable silence was building toward this.</p>

                <p>I know I haven't always shown up the way you deserve. When you told me I don't put in enough effort, it hurt, not because you said it, but because you were right. I see it now, and I'm genuinely sorry. You deserve someone who matches your energy, your care, your intentionality. I want to be that person. Not someday, starting now. I'm committed to being a better boyfriend, to showing you through actions, not just words, that you matter more to me than anything else in this world.</p>

                <p>Now, let me be entirely honest for a moment and forgive me for being a bit cheeky, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that you are, quite simply, devastatingly beautiful. Your body looks like something Michelangelo would've spent years trying to capture in marble. Greek goddess doesn't even cover it. Aphrodite herself would be taking notes. And that butt of yours? Chef's kiss. I'm convinced sculptors throughout history wept because they lived before you existed to serve as their muse. You're sexy in a way that makes my brain forget how to form coherent sentences. Sorry for the awkward pauses when I get to see you. Ahem.</p>

                <p>But beyond all of that, Adhora, you've become my greatest source of strength. You're my therapist when the world feels heavy, my cheerleader when I doubt myself, my lighthouse when I'm lost. You motivate me to step outside my comfort zone and pursue the things that actually matter. You don't just inspire my growth. You are the reason I believe I can bloom at all.</p>

                <p>I dream of us growing old together in our own home, with our own family. I see us in the kitchen, cooking side by side, the way you taught me to make that goru recipe I can never quite get as perfect as yours. I see us sharing bowls of your incredible pudding, the one that tastes like comfort and home. I imagine us dividing up house chores, bickering playfully about whose turn it is to do the dishes, and collapsing onto the couch together at the end of long days. Those simple, ordinary moments with you are the future I want most.</p>

                <p>Thank you for five years of friendship, for this beautiful chapter of love, and for every tomorrow we'll build together.</p>
